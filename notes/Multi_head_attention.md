Why would the whole embedding space be able to separate completely into different heads, and what each heads learns different relationship patterns

Excellent — this question gets to the **deepest conceptual layer** of multi-head attention:

> Why does splitting one embedding space into multiple “heads” help, and how do different heads learn different relationship patterns?

Let’s unpack this in three levels — **mechanistic**, **geometric**, and **functional**.

---

## 🧩 1️⃣ Mechanistic view — how heads are formed

Suppose your model has:

* Embedding size ( $d_\text{model} = 768$ )
* Number of heads ( h = 12 )
* So each head’s dimensionality ( d_h = 768 / 12 = 64 )

Each head has its **own linear projections**:
$$ Q_i = X W_Q^{(i)}, \quad K_i = X W_K^{(i)}, \quad V_i = X W_V^{(i)} $$
where $(W_Q^{(i)}\in\mathbb{R}^{768\times64})$, etc.

Each projection is learned **independently**.
They all start as random matrices and are trained jointly by backprop through the same loss (e.g., next-token cross-entropy).

So the model *learns* to use these parallel projections to extract **different, complementary subspaces of information** from the same token embeddings.

## 🧭 2️⃣ Geometric intuition — splitting the embedding space

You can think of the original token embedding (768-D) as a very rich vector that encodes many intertwined signals:

* lexical identity (“cat”, “dog”)
* position
* part of speech
* semantic role
* syntactic dependencies
* discourse context, etc.

Each head projects that 768-D space into its **own 64-D subspace** using its unique $(W_Q^{(i)}, W_K^{(i)}, W_V^{(i)})$.

Because these projection matrices are independent, **each head learns a different geometric lens** on the same input — focusing on different aspects of relationships between tokens.

The heads don’t literally “partition” the space; they *re-embed* it differently.

## 🧠 3️⃣ Functional intuition — what different heads learn

Empirically (from probing models like BERT, GPT-2, GPT-Neo):

| Head Type                   | What It Tends to Learn                     | Example Behavior                                                      |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Positional / Local head** | Short-range dependencies, local word order | Attends heavily to the previous token (“dog **sat** → on”)            |
| **Syntactic head**          | Grammatical structure                      | Links verbs to subjects (“cat **sat**”) or adjectives to nouns        |
| **Semantic head**           | Word meaning or topic similarity           | “Paris” attends to “France”, “dog” attends to “animal”                |
| **Copying / Identity head** | Reinforces token itself                    | High self-attention weight (useful for token retention)               |
| **Bridging head**           | Long-range dependency                      | Connects distant but related words (“if … then”, “question … answer”) |

Each head therefore captures a *different kind of contextual relationship*.
Their outputs are concatenated and linearly mixed:

$$ \text{MultiHead}(X) = \text{Concat}(O_1, O_2, \ldots, O_h) W_O $$

so the model can **blend** all these distinct perspectives into one contextual representation per token.

---

## 🎨 4️⃣ Why not one big head?

If you kept one large (Q, K, V) of size 768 each, you’d have:

* Only one attention map per token — one “relationship view.”
* Fewer learned projections → fewer inductive biases.
* It’s harder for one giant attention map to model both *local syntax* and *global meaning* at once.

Splitting into multiple heads gives the model:

* **Parallel diversity** — each head can specialize.
* **Independent gradients** — heads can explore different attention patterns.
* **Richer composition** — the final layer combines diverse contexts.

## 🧠 5️⃣ Analogy — a team of experts

Imagine you have one document and twelve experts:

| Expert | Specialty                    |
| :----- | :--------------------------- |
| 1      | Grammar links (subject–verb) |
| 2      | Pronoun references           |
| 3      | Long-distance dependencies   |
| 4      | Topic similarity             |
| 5      | Position tracking            |
| …      | …                            |

Each expert reads the same text (same embedding (X)) but highlights different relationships.
After all experts finish, you merge their notes → a complete understanding.

That’s exactly what multi-head attention does.

## ✅ Summary

| Multi-head attention    | Splits the model dimension into several independent projections                               |
| Each head               | Learns its own query/key/value mappings (different subspaces)                                 |
| Heads learn differently | Because their parameters evolve separately under the same loss                                |
| Effect                  | Each head captures a distinct type of contextual relation (syntax, semantics, position, etc.) |
| Benefit                 | Richer representation, parallel relational reasoning, better optimization stability           |

If you’d like, I can **visualize this idea** with a Figma-style block diagram — showing one token embedding branching into multiple heads, each producing its own attention map and then recombining.
Would you like me to draw that next?
