# Does `self(idx)` = `self.forward(idx)` when calling the model?
Question: When I implement the `generate()` module of the `BigramLanguageModel` class, I was really confused when I see `logits, loss = self(idx)`, so I wonder whether it's the same as `self.forward(idx)`

Answer:

Excellent question ‚Äî this is a subtle but *core* concept of PyTorch‚Äôs `nn.Module` class and how `forward()` is automatically tied to the instance itself.

Let‚Äôs unpack it step-by-step üëá

### üß† What happens when you call `self(idx)`?

When you write:

```python
logits, loss = self(idx)
```

it‚Äôs **syntactic sugar** for:

```python
logits, loss = self.forward(idx)
```

That‚Äôs because `nn.Module` defines the special method `__call__` like this (simplified):

```python
def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # some internal setup (e.g. hooks, pre/post-processing)
    return self.forward(*args, **kwargs)
```

So when you call your model instance (e.g., `model(x)` or `self(x)` inside the class), PyTorch automatically invokes its `forward()` method, while also handling things like:

* `torch.no_grad()` contexts
* hooks
* device placement
* distributed data parallel layers

That‚Äôs why PyTorch recommends **not** calling `forward()` directly ‚Äî you should always call the module itself like a function (`model(x)`), so these built-in features work properly.

### ‚öôÔ∏è In your specific code

```python
logits, loss = self(idx)
```

‚û°Ô∏è This calls `self.forward(idx)`
‚û°Ô∏è which runs:

```python
logits = self.embedding_table(idx)
```

Here‚Äôs what happens conceptually:

1. `idx` has shape `(B, T)` ‚Äî the batch of token IDs.
2. `self.embedding_table(idx)` looks up each token ID in the `vocab_size √ó vocab_size` embedding table.

   * So the output `logits` has shape `(B, T, vocab_size)`
     ‚Äî each token position gives you a probability distribution (logits) for the next token.

| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `self(idx)`                         | Calls `self.forward(idx)`                                   |
| `forward()`                         | Defines how input ‚Üí output happens                          |
| Don‚Äôt use `self.forward()` directly | It bypasses PyTorch internals (hooks, no_grad, DDP, etc.)   |
| `generate()` loop                   | Keeps feeding the model‚Äôs own predictions back as new input |
