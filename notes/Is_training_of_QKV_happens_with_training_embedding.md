💯 **Yes — exactly.**
The entire *self-attention mechanism* — the (Q, K, V) projections and their weights — is trained *within and upon* the same **embedding space** you’ve been asking about.
Let’s break this down clearly and intuitively, layer by layer 👇

---

## 🔹 1. Starting point: the embedding space

After token embedding + positional encoding, your input has shape
$$ x \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times n_{embd}} $$
Each token now lives in the **embedding space** of dimension (n_{embd}).

At this point:

* Every token vector (x_{b,t,:}) = a point in the embedding space.
* The model’s job is to learn how these points relate — which tokens should “attend” to which others, and by how much.

---

## 🔹 2. Linear projections: Q, K, V are learned mappings *within* this space

Each attention head learns **three linear transformations**:

$$ Q = x W_Q, \quad K = x W_K, \quad V = x W_V $$

where each (W) is a trainable weight matrix:

$$ (W_Q, W_K, W_V \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{embd} \times head_size}) $$

So what’s happening here?

### ✅ They’re still operating in the *embedding feature space*, but...

* They **reorient** the axes — mapping the original embedding into new subspaces specialized for:

  * **Q**: what information this token *wants* to query.
  * **K**: what information this token *offers* to others.
  * **V**: the actual content that gets passed around once attention weights are applied.

Each of these is a *linear projection* of the same underlying features.

So you can think of (W_Q, W_K, W_V) as *learned “feature lenses”* that select and reweight embedding dimensions for the purpose of comparing tokens.

## 🔹 3. Attention calculation — still geometric in the embedding space

For one head:

$$ \text{Attention}(x) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V $$

* The **dot product (QK^T)** is literally a **similarity measure** *within this subspace*.
* It’s like computing pairwise cosine-like affinities between tokens — but learned directions, not fixed ones.
* This happens independently for each sequence in the batch.

So attention is a *geometric operation inside the embedding space*: it measures how aligned two tokens’ projected representations are.

---

## 🔹 4. Backpropagation trains everything jointly

During training:

* The model’s **loss** (e.g., cross-entropy on next-token prediction) flows backward through all layers.
* Gradients update:

  * $(W_Q, W_K, W_V)$: how to best represent attention directions
  * $(W_{proj})$: how to recombine multiple heads
  * The embedding matrix (E): how each token’s initial vector should move in the embedding space so that the attention layers can use it more effectively

So:

> The Transformer jointly learns both *the shape of the embedding space* (via (E)) and *the operations inside that space* (via (W_Q, W_K, W_V), feed-forwards, etc.).

They co-evolve during training — the embedding adjusts to what the attention layers find useful, and attention layers adapt to the new embedding geometry.

## 🔹 5. Big-picture geometry intuition

Here’s a geometric way to visualize it:

| Component                            | Role in embedding space                                    | Analogy                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Embedding matrix (E)**             | Defines the coordinate system where tokens live            | “What does each word *mean* in this world?”               |
| **Q, K, V projections**              | Learn how to view and compare those meanings               | “Which features matter for this context?”                 |
| **Attention weights (softmax(QKᵀ))** | Compute token-to-token influence based on learned geometry | “Which words should talk to which?”                       |
| **Feed-forward network**             | Applies nonlinear transformations in the same space        | “Refine each word’s representation after gathering info.” |

---

✅ **In summary:**

> Yes — Q, K, V training happens *within the same embedding feature space.*
> They are linear maps that learn specialized *subspaces* for comparison (queries/keys) and information passing (values).
> All of these parameters — embeddings, attention weights, projection layers — are jointly trained end-to-end so the geometry of the embedding space itself becomes optimal for modeling all text.
