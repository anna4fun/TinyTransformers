# Embedding as the feature space

In classic tabular ML problems, we see the input `X` to have columns `[x₁, x₂, x₃, …]` as features and rows as samples. 

Transformers has the same inputs, except that the features now has a new name: the **Embedding**.
Each token embedding `x[b,t,n_embd]` is just  like a feature vector `[x₁, x₂, x₃, …, xₙ_embd]` in tabular data.
We can now read the `(B, T, n_embd)` shaped input tensor as:

| Axis       | Meaning                | Analogy in tabular data                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **B**      | batch of sequences     | multiple independent datasets             |
| **T**      | tokens in one sequence | *samples within that dataset*             |
| **n_embd** | embedding dimension    | *features describing each sample (token)* |

---

## What does Embedding encode?
Each token embedding (length = n_embd) encodes:

* syntactic info (position, word identity, grammar role)

* semantic info (meaning, context, relationships to other words)

So it’s conceptually equivalent to a dense vector of features describing the token, learned by the network. And this set the pave for splitting the embedding space into multiple heads to train their information separately.

🔥 Excellent pair of questions — you’re digging right into the *core geometry* of how Transformers work.
Let’s unpack both carefully and precisely.

---

## 🧩 **Q1: Is the Transformer training trying to find optimal embedding space values so that the embedding space can represent all the training text?**

**✅ Yes — that’s fundamentally what’s happening.**
But let’s make this precise: the model isn’t optimizing the *embedding space* directly — it’s optimizing **the parameters of the embedding and attention networks** so that:

> Each token’s embedding lands in a high-dimensional space where the model can represent and predict relationships between tokens across all training text.

### How that works

1. **Embedding matrix**

   * You start with a learnable matrix ( $ E \in \mathbb{R}^{V \times n_{embd}} $)
     where (V) = vocabulary size, `n_embd` = embedding dimension.
   * Each token (i) maps to a row (E[i,:]): a vector of `n_embd` features.

2. **Forward pass**

   * Given a batch of token indices, you lookup their rows → embeddings.
   * These go through multi-head attention and feed-forward layers that transform and contextualize them (so embeddings become “contextual embeddings”).

3. **Loss and backpropagation**

   * At the end, the model tries to predict the next token (or masked token).
   * The gradient of that prediction error flows back through all layers — including the **embedding matrix** itself.
   * That updates (E) so that similar tokens (semantically or syntactically) move closer in this space, and dissimilar ones move apart — because that arrangement reduces the prediction loss.

So yes — training gradually *shapes* the embedding space geometry so that it can efficiently represent all training text and the relationships the model needs to capture.

👉 In other words:

* **The Transformer doesn’t memorize text;** it learns a geometry (the embedding manifold) where language structure is linearly and relationally expressible.
* The rest of the Transformer layers learn to *operate* on that geometry.

---

## 🧠 **Q2: Why do we need to normalize the embedding per token?**

Great question — this goes to *numerical stability* and *training dynamics.*

### 1️⃣ Internal covariate shift

Each sublayer (attention or feed-forward) continuously transforms token representations.
Without normalization, the distribution of activations (mean/std) could drift layer by layer — making training unstable and gradients explode or vanish.

LayerNorm ensures that:

> Each token’s feature vector has consistent scale (mean 0, std 1) before entering the next layer.

That stabilizes gradient flow and keeps training numerically well-behaved.

---

### 2️⃣ Gradient flow through deep residual stacks

Transformers stack dozens (or hundreds) of blocks, each with residual connections.
Residual paths add the previous activations back in.
If those activations are not normalized, their scale can grow uncontrollably, hurting optimization.

LayerNorm keeps those residual signals at a predictable magnitude.

---

### 3️⃣ Independence between tokens

Normalizing **per token** (instead of across tokens or batch) ensures:

* Each token’s representation is normalized independently.
* It doesn’t “leak” information between tokens — which would break causal or masked setups.

So each token embedding is standardized on its own local feature statistics, keeping representations consistent across positions and samples.

---

### 4️⃣ Optional intuition: “rounding off the space”

Think geometrically:
Without LayerNorm, embedding vectors might have arbitrary lengths — some tokens might live on the edges of the high-dimensional sphere; others near the center.
Attention scores (dot products of queries/keys) depend on vector magnitudes.
Normalization makes those magnitudes comparable — putting all embeddings roughly on a similar scale so attention focuses on **directional** similarity (cosine-like), not arbitrary length differences.

| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Is training optimizing the embedding space?** | Yes — the Transformer learns parameters (embedding matrix + layers) that shape an embedding space where language relationships are representable and predictive.                                                |
| **2. Why normalize per token?**                    | To stabilize activations and gradients, prevent feature drift, keep residuals bounded, and make attention compare directions rather than magnitudes — ensuring each token’s features are on a consistent scale. |

If you want, I can illustrate visually (with a 2D toy example) how embeddings form a cluster structure before and after normalization — it makes the “direction vs magnitude” intuition very clear. Would you like that?




## Layer Norm vs Batch Norm, why Transformer chose Layer Norm

### Layer Norm vs Batch Norm

Let’s restate clearly:

* **LayerNorm → normalizes *rows*** (per sample)
* **BatchNorm → normalizes *columns*** (per feature across the batch)

Here’s the detailed comparison 👇

---

#### 🔹 1. LayerNorm (LN)

* **Normalizes across features within a single sample**
* For Transformers: per token (`x[b,t,:]`)


$$ \text{LN}(x_{b,t,:}) = \frac{x_{b,t,:} - \mu_{b,t}}{\sigma_{b,t}} $$
where
$$(\mu_{b,t} = \frac{1}{n_\text{embd}} \sum_i x_{b,t,i})$$

$$(\sigma_{b,t}^2 = \frac{1}{n_\text{embd}} \sum_i (x_{b,t,i} - \mu_{b,t})^2) $$

✅ Normalization is **row-wise** (across features of one token).
❌ Does *not* look at other tokens or other samples in the batch.

So LayerNorm makes every **token vector** have mean 0 and std 1.

---

#### 🔹 2. BatchNorm (BN)

* **Normalizes across the batch for each feature dimension**
* For example, in a 2D input `(B, n_features)`:

$$ \text{BN}(x_{b,i}) = \frac{x_{b,i} - \mu_i}{\sigma_i} $$
where
$$ (\mu_i = \frac{1}{B} \sum_b x_{b,i}) $$
$$ (\sigma_i^2 = \frac{1}{B} \sum_b (x_{b,i} - \mu_i)^2) $$

✅ Normalization is **column-wise** (feature-wise across samples).
❌ Doesn’t preserve per-sample independence.

So BatchNorm makes every **feature column** have mean 0 and std 1 *across the batch*.

---

#### 🔹 3. Why Transformers use LayerNorm, not BatchNorm

Because in sequence modeling:

* Each token is processed independently across the batch.
* Sequence lengths vary (batch statistics unstable).
* BatchNorm depends on global batch stats (μ, σ), which can change across GPUs and make distributed training tricky.
* LayerNorm is independent of batch size and sequence length — deterministic and stable.

So Transformers normalize **within each token’s feature vector**, not across the batch.

---

#### 🔹 4. Analogy Table

| Type             | Normalization axis  | Works across             | Formula scope     | Common in          |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| **BatchNorm**    | features (`n_embd`) | samples (batch)          | across batch      | CNNs, MLPs         |
| **LayerNorm**    | features (`n_embd`) | within one sample        | within token      | Transformers, RNNs |
| **InstanceNorm** | spatial dims        | within one image/channel | image style tasks |                    |
| **GroupNorm**    | group of channels   | within one sample        | CNN alternatives  |                    |

---

✅ **So you’re 100% right:**
LayerNorm ≈ row-wise normalization (per sample),
BatchNorm ≈ column-wise normalization (per feature across batch).

My earlier phrasing — “like standardizing columns in tabular ML” — was conceptually about “normalizing feature scales,” but technically **LayerNorm operates across features within a row**, not across rows.

---

If you want a one-line mental model:

> **BatchNorm:** “Each feature behaves consistently across the dataset.”
> **LayerNorm:** “Each sample (token) behaves consistently across its own features.”

Would you like a small numeric example (say a 3×4 matrix) showing exactly how LN and BN compute different means and stds over axes?


Each token embedding (length = `n_embd`) encodes syntactic and semantic infor. So it’s conceptually equivalent to:

> A dense vector of *features describing the token*, learned by the network.

That’s also why **LayerNorm** acts across this dimension — it normalizes the *features describing a single token*, just like you’d standardize columns in tabular ML.

---

#### 5.🔹 Why this matters

It lets you interpret the Transformer pipeline as:

```
(B, T, n_embd)
  ↑  ↑   ↑
  |  |   └── feature axis (embedding values, like x₁…xₙ)
  |  └────── token axis (samples in sequence)
  └────────── batch axis (independent sequences)
```

So when we say:

```python
nn.LayerNorm(n_embd)
```

we’re saying:

> “For each token sample, normalize across its feature vector (embedding).”

---

#### 6.🔹 Connecting to attention

When you compute `Q = xW_Q`, `K = xW_K`, `V = xW_V` —
each linear projection mixes **features within a token’s embedding**, not across tokens.
Attention then brings in *cross-token* interaction later via `QKᵀ`.

So there’s a clean separation of concerns:

| Stage         | Operates over          | Analogy                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Linear layers | feature dim (`n_embd`) | mix features of each sample   |
| Attention     | token dim (`T`)        | mix samples within a sequence |
| LayerNorm     | feature dim (`n_embd`) | normalize features per sample |

---

✅ **Summary (your intuition is spot-on):**

> In Transformers, each token is like a sample, and its embedding vector is like the sample’s feature vector.
> `n_embd` is the feature dimension; `T` is how many samples (tokens) you have per sequence.
> LayerNorm normalizes features, not samples — exactly like feature standardization in tabular ML(just row-wise).
