# Build a Tiny Transformers (Decoder Only)
This repository contains my code and notes for implementing a tiny decoder only transformers, 
following Andrej Karpathy's YouTube video [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=6576s). 
This repo was forked from the lecture's [repo](https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture)

I plan to integrate MLFlow into this repo for experiment instrumentation.
