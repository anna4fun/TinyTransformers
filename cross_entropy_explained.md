# Why is Cross Entropy taking a negative log likelihood when it's so similar with Maximum Likelihood Estimation?
Question: Can you explain cross-entropy loss for me using a sample token vector here? I understand the cross-entropy to be similar with the maximum likelihood estimation in statistics, where each token i would generates a vocab_size probabilities that adds up to 1, and then we will compare the probability list with the actual next token and calculate the probability of making wrong prediction for token i, then we will do a negative log likelihood of this "probability of making wrong prediction for token i" and average it across all the tokens. my question is: why having the negative log likelihood here, I thought taking the log of the probability of making the wrong prediction is enough

That’s a *fantastic* and very insightful question — and you’re right that **cross-entropy loss** is the same thing as **negative log-likelihood (NLL)** training. The subtle point you’re catching is about *what* we take the log of and *why the negative sign is there*. Let’s walk through this slowly and precisely 👇

---

## 🧩 1️⃣ Setup: what happens for one token prediction

Suppose your model sees token *i* and outputs a vector of raw scores (“logits”) for the next token:

```
logits = [2.0, 0.5, -1.0]         # three tokens in vocab
```

Apply softmax to turn these into probabilities:

[
p_j = \frac{e^{\text{logit}_j}}{\sum_k e^{\text{logit}_k}}
]

Say that gives:

```
probs = [0.7, 0.2, 0.1]
```

If the **true next token** is token 1 (index 0 in 0-based code), the ideal target distribution is:

```
target = [1, 0, 0]
```

## 🧠 2️⃣ Cross-entropy as the expected log-loss

The **cross-entropy** between target `q` and predicted `p` is

[
H(q,p) = -\sum_j q_j \log p_j
]

For a one-hot target (the true token is `j*`):

[
H(q,p) = -\log p_{j*}
]

So for our example:

```
loss = -log(0.7) = 0.357
```

That’s the **negative log-likelihood** of the correct token.

---

## ⚙️ 3️⃣ Why the **negative** sign?

Because we want to **maximize** the likelihood (p_{j*}) of the correct token,
but optimizers *minimize* losses.

* Maximum-likelihood estimation: maximize ( \log p_{j*} )
* Cross-entropy loss: minimize ( -\log p_{j*} )

So the negative sign simply flips a maximization into a minimization problem that gradient descent can handle.

---

## 🧩 4️⃣ Why not “probability of making the wrong prediction”?

You could in theory write
[
1 - p_{j*}
]
and try to minimize that, but that function is **flat** near 1 and **non-smooth** near 0 — bad for learning.

The log brings two crucial benefits:

1. **Convexity / curvature**: makes large errors (small (p_{j*})) penalized more strongly and yields smooth gradients.
2. **Additivity**: logs turn products of probabilities into sums, so averaging across time steps = total log-likelihood over the corpus.

## 🧮 5️⃣ Example: why log matters

| (p_{\text{correct}}) | (1 - p) | (-\log p) |
| -------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| 0.9                  | 0.1     | 0.105     |
| 0.5                  | 0.5     | 0.693     |
| 0.1                  | 0.9     | 2.303     |

* With (1-p): difference between 0.5 and 0.1 is only 0.4.
* With (-\log p): difference is 1.61 — much larger penalty → stronger gradient when the model is very wrong.

That steep slope near small (p) is what drives learning fast when predictions are bad.

---

## 🧭 6️⃣ Averaging over all tokens

For a batch of B×T tokens:

[
\text{Loss} = -\frac{1}{BT}\sum_{b,t} \log p_{\theta}(x_{b,t}^{\text{true}} \mid \text{context})
]

This is exactly the **negative average log-likelihood**, i.e. **cross-entropy loss**.

---

✅ **TL;DR**

* Cross-entropy = negative log-likelihood of the correct class.
* We take the **log** to make probabilities additive and penalize confident mistakes strongly.
* We put a **negative** sign because gradient descent minimizes loss instead of maximizing likelihood.
* In a language model, it means:

  > “Give higher probability to the true next token, and penalize you exponentially for being confident about the wrong one.”
