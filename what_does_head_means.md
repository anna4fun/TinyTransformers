# Does the head from Single-head and Multi-head attention stands for sub-neural-net to be trained?
Question: what does head means in transformer and why it's value is tie with embedding dimension? does head means the number of separate neural networks and parameters we want to train on the dataset, and the embedding spaces is sliced to be trained by these heads/neural nets?

Fantastic — you’re now stepping into the core intuition of *multi-head attention*, and you’re already 90 % conceptually there.
Let’s go step by step and tie together what a “head” really means, why it’s linked to the embedding dimension, and what role it plays in the model.

## 🧩 1️⃣ What a “head” is

In self-attention, every token embedding $(x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{C})$ is projected into three vectors:

$$ Q_i = x_i W_Q,\quad K_i = x_i W_K,\quad V_i = x_i W_V $$

Each projection matrix has shape `(C, d_head)`.

> A **head** is one *independent set* of those three projections (Q, K, V) that computes its own attention pattern over the sequence.

So:

* **1 head** = one attention computation over the entire sequence (one “view” of relationships).
* **h heads** = h parallel attention computations, each with its own learned Q/K/V weights.

Each head attends to tokens in slightly different ways — one might focus on syntactic relations, another on long-distance dependencies, another on capitalization, etc.

## 🧠 2️⃣ Why “multi-head”

If we used only one attention mechanism of size `C`, it would learn a *single correlation pattern* across all features.
By splitting into multiple smaller heads, the model can:

* learn **different types of relationships** in parallel
* reduce the cost per head (smaller matrices)
* increase expressiveness without exploding parameters.

## 🧮 3️⃣ How the math ties to the embedding dimension

Say your total embedding dimension is `C = n_embd = 384`, and you choose `n_head = 6`.

Then each head’s subspace dimension is:

$$ d_{\text{head}} = C / n_{\text{head}} = 384 / 6 = 64 $$

Each head has its own parameter sets:

| projection | shape per head | meaning |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------- |
| (W_Q)      | `(C, d_head)`  | queries |
| (W_K)      | `(C, d_head)`  | keys    |
| (W_V)      | `(C, d_head)`  | values  |

All heads run in parallel:

```python
Q, K, V = linear_Q(x), linear_K(x), linear_V(x)   # (B,T,C)
Q = Q.view(B, T, n_head, d_head).transpose(1,2)   # (B, n_head, T, d_head)
# same for K,V
```

After computing attention per head, you concatenate them back:
$$ \text{concat}(head_1, \dots, head_h) \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times C} $$
and project through a final linear layer (`W_O`) to mix information between heads.

So **the total embedding dimension C stays constant** — it’s just partitioned across heads.

---

## 🧩 4️⃣ Are heads “separate neural networks”?

Sort of — each head has its *own* Q/K/V linear projections (i.e. its own small parameter sets), so you can think of them as **parallel mini-networks** that look at the same tokens but through different learned lenses.
However:

* They are **not trained on disjoint data** — every head sees all the same batches.
* They are trained **jointly** within one overall Transformer block.

## 🧭 5️⃣ Intuitive summary

| Concept                     | Meaning                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Embedding dimension (C)** | Total size of each token’s feature vector.                                                        |
| **Head**                    | One independent attention mechanism with its own Q/K/V parameters.                                |
| **d_head = C / n_head**     | Feature subspace size each head operates in.                                                      |
| **Multi-head attention**    | Run h attention computations in parallel, each focusing on different relationships, then combine. |

### Example: why multi-head works in practice

* Head 1: focuses on recent tokens (“the next word after *the* is likely *dog*”).
* Head 2: captures long-range dependency (“if there’s an opening parenthesis, find its closing one”).
* Head 3: learns part-of-speech alignment.
* …
* Concatenation of all heads → one rich representation per token.

### TL;DR

> A **head** in a Transformer is one independent self-attention mechanism with its own Q/K/V projection matrices.
> The **embedding dimension (C)** is divided among heads:
$ (d_{\text{head}} = C / n_{\text{head}})$ 
>
> Multiple heads ≠ multiple datasets — they’re parallel “perspectives” on the same data, allowing the model to learn diverse relational patterns.
